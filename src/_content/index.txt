Hello. I'm Trevor. This is my studio, Continuum Design. I'm glad you're here.

Elevator pitch
Continuum Design is a small design agency. As in one person. I have nearly twenty years of experience, including print design, brand identity, user experience, and web development. I work primarily with small businesses who want to improve their search rank and make it easier for customers to connect online.

How I work
It starts with a meeting, in person when possible, and online when not. I tend to listen, take notes, and ask a few open-ended questions. I want to get to know your business. To understand your goals, and what you hope to achieve by partnering with Continuum Design.

A typical engagement might look like:
1. First meeting - This will usually be a video call (Google Chat, Skype, Zoom) but could be in-person
2. Comparative analysis - I will review your goals against peer competitors and write a proposal of work
3. First quote - The first quote will include work to be done, an estimate of hours, and an hourly cost rate
4. Quote amendments - Any change requests will be added to the quote document before a contract is drafted
5. Contract - After the quote amendments are agreed upon, Continuum Design will send the customer a simple contract to sign
6. Work begins - Once the contract is signed, a 50% deposit will be collected and work will begin

## What a website can do for you

Potential customers are often lost at three critical points. A website must be easy to find, look great on small screens, and provide a clear call to action. 

## Search results are the first step to new customers

Incomplete listings can send the wrong message. Customers will skip search listings that don't provide a web link, telephone number, or physical address. You want your business to stand out in a crowded field and you have just a few seconds to make an impression.

### Search engine optimization (SEO)

Continuum Design uses good SEO practices to get your website noticed. I will design a custom data profile that will help Google and other search engines understand your business. Search engines reward these good practices with higher listings. I can also connect your website to social media sites like Facebook or Instagram.

## Responsive design is good design

Customers want a website to look good and be easy to read. Sites should repsond to the size of your screen, so they're easy to read and use. This is responsive design in a nutshell. Continuum Design will lean on  twenty years of design experience to create a look that puts your best foot forward, then code it to adapt to screens of all sizes.

## Help customers say yes

So customers have found your site, and are impressed with your business. They're ready to take the next step. Do they have a clear path to contact you?

Continuum Design will develop the right solution for you to follow up with customers. That could be a simple contact form and email, or integration with your social media feed.

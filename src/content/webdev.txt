## What a website can do for you

Potential customers are often lost at three critical points. A website must be easy to find, look great on small screens, and make it easy for customers to contact you. 

## Search results are the first step to new customers

Customers who are looking at search results will skip listings that don't offer a web link, telephone number, or physical address. Incomplete listings communicate businesses are not taking new customers or only work on referrals. Regardless, you want your business to stand out in a list of search results. 

### Search engine optimization (SEO)

Continuum Design uses good SEO practices to get your website noticed. I can connect your website to social media like Facebook or Instagram. I will design a custom data profile that will help Google and other search engines understand what you do, and how to contact you. Search engines reward these good practices with higher listings and more information. Continuum Design will make it easier for customers to say "Yes" to your business.

## Responsive design is good design

Customers expect a website that is looks good and is easy to read. Websites today should not look the same on a smartphone as a large desktop screen. These sites are either too large to read comfortably on a phone, or too small to read on the desktop. Either way, customers will look elsewhere.

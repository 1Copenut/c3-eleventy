# Continuum Design can bring your business online

Word-of-mouth is the best way to drive new business. A properly optimized website is a close second.

## What a website can do for you

Potential customers are often lost at three critical points. A website must be easy to find, look great on small screens, and make it easy for customers to contact you. 

### Easy to find

Customers who are looking at search results will skip listings that don't offer a web link, telephone number, or physical address. Incomplete listings communicate businesses are not taking new customers or only work on referrals. Regardless, you want your business to stand out in a list of search results. 

Continuum Design uses good search engine optimization (SEO) practices to get your website noticed. I can connect your website to social media like Facebook or Instagram. I will design a custom data profile that will help Google and other search engines understand what you do, and how to contact you. Search engines reward these good practices with higher listings and more information. Continuum Design will make it easier for customers to say "Yes" to your business.

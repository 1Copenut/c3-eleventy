A brand name can set your business apart

Identity design, also known as branding, is the art of creating a visual symbol for your business. This could be your business name in a logotype, an abstract shape, or a simple version of your company seal. Branding is about knowing what to keep and what to remove. Branding makes it clear this symbol represents your business.

## Start with an interview

Continuum Design will meet with you in person or over a video chat, to get to know you and your business. I will ask about the history, important dates or events, and what the business means to you. These questions are crucial. They help me create an identity to serve your business well.

## Sketch the best ideas

After the interview, I will gather my notes and create a design brief. I will share this brief with you and your stakeholders. Then I will start sketching the two or three best ideas for an identity. These sketches will capture the most important ideas we outlined in the design brief.

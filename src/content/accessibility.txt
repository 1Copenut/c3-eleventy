Accessible by design. Accessible by choice.

Accessibility is meeting your customers where they are. Making sure your website is usable for someone who only uses a smart phone. For someone who is deaf or hard-of-hearing. For someone who is blind or someone who prefers a light-touch selling experience. It is all of these things and more. 

Accessibility starts with the end in mind.

We achieve the best outcome when we make accessibility a requirement instead of a check before launching a website. Sites are easier to change because code hasn't been added to fix existing problems. As a result, sites are easier to test&mdash;fewer lines of code mean fewer bugs.

Continuum Design specializes in web and document accessibility:
* User-interface design
* User-experience design
* Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ARIA)
* Manual testing (more on this below)
* Automated testing (more on this below)
* WCAG2.0 and 2.1 standards
* PDF, Word document creation

Automated testing

Autmated tests are a great way to ensure a baseline of compliance. Unit tests check small snippets of code like a shopping cart or a navigation bar. Integration tests make sure units are working together. End-to-end tests confirm user actions from beginning to end. Visual regression tests make sure your site layout has not changed unexpectedly.

Manual testing

A significant part of accessibility testing can be automated, but there are key things that must be tested by a person. Computers do a great job repeating the same task over and over, asking if anything has changed. But it takes a person to ansewr "How does this website, how does this application work? Can I use it without getting frustrated or discouraged? Does it make me feel good about this purchase?"

I test websites and applications manually to ensure inclusiveness for:

* Mobile device users (smartphones, tablets)
* Keyboard navigation
* Voice navigation
* Color contrast and color blindness
* Screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver)

    <h2>Print</h2>
    <p>
      Print design is what you're looking for if you need a poster, brochure, or letterhead. I can design simple, one-color brochures all the way up to full-color posters. I will work with you to select paper, colors, and a printer. We will explore different printing options like soy-based inks or digital offset printing to match your budget.

    <h2>User-interface Design</h2>
    <p>
      User-interface or UI design, is like visual design, but incorporates interaction, animation, and screen size to create web pages users can interact with. UI design decides what color to make the submit button and how to organize content neatly. UI design is closely related to user-experience or UX design.

    <h2>User-experience Design</h2>
    <p>
      UX design explores the steps users take to accomplish a task. Common UX problems include signing up for a newsletter, ecommerce checkouts, and selecting photos for upload. UX often involves custom interfaces and multi-step forms for collecting data. UX design adopts ideas from psychology about how we learn and perceive information, to help customers perform tasks easily.

    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      Data visualization is a niche specialty for organizing data into charts and tables. The data is then used to tell a story like rate of change or sports statistics. Charts are often paired with tables to offer visual and semantic stories that are accessible to a wide audience. The trick is knowing what display to use, and how to organize the data to tell your story, not just a story.

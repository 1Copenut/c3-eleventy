        Identity design, also known as branding, is the art of creating a visual symbol for your business. This could be your business name in a logotype, an abstract shape, or a simple version of your company seal. Branding is about knowing what to keep and what to remove. Branding makes it clear this symbol represents your business.

    <h2>Start with an interview</h2>
    <p>
      Continuum Design will meet with you in person or over a video chat, to get to know you and your business. I will ask about the history, important dates or events, and what the business means to you. These questions are crucial. They help me create an identity to serve your business well.
    </p>

    <h2>Sketch the best ideas</h2>
    <p>
      After the interview, I will gather my notes and create a design brief. I will share this brief with you and your stakeholders. Then I will start sketching the two or three best ideas for an identity. These sketches will capture the most important ideas we outlined in the design brief.
    </p>

    <h2>Iterate on the best prototype</h2>
    <p>
      Continuum Design will present the two or three best ideas for you to choose from. I will discuss the merits of each idea and leave the samples so you can think about the right one for a few days. These samples will be in black and white only. Brands must work in black and white before they can work in color.
    </p>

    <p>Once you have selected the brand that fits your business, Continuum Design will start adding color to the mark, and creating size tests. Size tests ensure your brand looks its best on screen, on letterhead, business cards, at any size.</p>

    <h2>Deliver camera-ready files</h2>
    <p>All size tests, black and white, and color versions of your brand will become your property when final payment is received. Continuum Design will provide digital versions of your artwork in camera-ready vector files. This means printers will be able to open your files and go to press without expensive setup or rework.</p>

    <p>Continuum Design will keep a back-up of your digital files in case the worst happens. This backup will be secured with strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>

    <h2>Consider a style guide</h2>
    <p>
      If your brand will be used in a large number of ways and sizes (letterhead, screen, vehicles) you should consider a style guide. This is a digital (or printed) file that outlines where and how your brand should be use. It calls out clear space requirements, proper sizes, colors, and placement. The style guide also calls out things that should be avoided, like using the brand in color on a black background, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>Style guides take additional time to produce, but offer a comprehensive reference for using your brand correctly. A style guide will help you represent your business in the best light, no matter the source.</p>
